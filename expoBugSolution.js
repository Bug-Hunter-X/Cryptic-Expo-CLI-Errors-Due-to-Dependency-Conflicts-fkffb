The solution involves meticulously examining your `package.json` file.  Ensure that all Expo and React Native packages are compatible. Use a package manager like npm or yarn to resolve conflicts and lock versions. For native modules, double-check compatibility with your Expo SDK version.  Consider using a tool like `npm-check-updates` to identify outdated packages.  A clean installation after resolving dependencies might be beneficial: `rm -rf node_modules && yarn cache clean && yarn install` or `rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clean --force && npm install`.
