This error typically arises when using the Expo CLI with a project that has conflicting or improperly configured dependencies.  It can manifest as a cryptic error message during various CLI commands like `expo start` or `expo build`. The root cause often lies in mismatched versions of Expo modules, React Native libraries, or native modules.
